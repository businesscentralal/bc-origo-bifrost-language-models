# Bifrost Language Models — Agent Context

This file gives AI agents the big-picture context needed to work in this repository correctly and safely.

## What This Extension Does

**Bifrost Language Models** is the chat module of the Bifröst platform for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. It puts a conversational assistant inside Business Central and gives that assistant a way to read and act on company data.

Four capabilities:

1. **Bifrost Chat** — a JavaScript control add-in rendered in a FactBox on 36 standard pages and on a focused full-page view. It carries the current record as conversation context.
2. **Language models** — a setup table that holds provider configuration (endpoint, model, token budget, API key handling) and a Markdown *skill* text that is injected into every conversation. One model can be the default; a model can also be assigned per user.
3. **Providers** — an interface + enum pair. Bifrost Language Models ships the Microsoft Copilot / Azure OpenAI provider; other extensions add their own by extending the enum.
4. **MCP tool server** — exposes Business Central operations (search, read, write, files, memory, navigation, `invoke_message_type`) as Model Context Protocol tools, executed under the signed-in user's own permissions.

Plus one message type, `LLM.Prompt.Complete`, for one-shot completions in playbooks and scheduled tasks — no tools, no conversation state.

---

## Who Uses It

- Business Central users who chat with the assistant from a record page.
- Playbooks and scheduled tasks that need a reasoning or text-generation step, through `LLM.Prompt.Complete`.
- Origo and partner extensions that add a language model provider.

## Relationship to Bifrost Foundation

Bifrost Language Models **depends on** Bifrost Foundation and installs beside it. Foundation owns the message loop, the setup, the user setup and the request log; Bifrost Language Models extends them:

| Foundation object | Bifrost Language Models extension | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| enum `Message Type ori` | `LangModel Message Type ori` | registers `LLM.Prompt.Complete` |
| enum `Request Log Type ori` | `LangModel Req Log Type ori` | registers `Copilot` + its secret masker |
| table `User Setup ori` | `User Setup LangModel ori` | field `Bifrost Language Model Code` |
| page `User Setup Editor ori` | `User Setup Editor LangMdl ori` | the field + the chat FactBox |
| page `Setup ori` | `Setup LangModel ori` | the **Bifrost Language Models** action |

**Never** ask for a change in Foundation that Bifrost Language Models can make through an extension object.

Foundation's `Help WhoAmI Get Impl ori` is `Access = Internal`. Bifrost Language Models cannot call it. `Bifrost Chat Utils ori.GetIdentityJson()` runs the public `Help.WhoAmI.Get` message type through Foundation's `Msg Interface ori` instead, and strips the response `status` and the personal `systemPrompt`.

## Core Architectural Concepts

### Chat provider dispatch (moved to Foundation, #21/#7)

The chat control add-in, FactBox/Focus pages, `Bifrost Chat Mgt ori`, `Bifrost Chat Transfer ori`, `Chat Gate ori` and the MCP Tool Server now live in **Bifrost Foundation**. Foundation's `Bifrost Chat Mgt ori` is a thin facade: it checks the permission gate, resolves `Setup ori`.`Chat Provider Type` (a Foundation enum), and delegates every operation to the active `Chat Provider ori` implementation.

Language Models registers itself on that enum (value `LanguageModels`) via `LangModel Chat Provider Type` and implements `Chat Provider ori` in `LangModel Chat Provider ori` (object 10035382, reusing the old `Bifrost Chat Mgt ori` slot). `Copilot Install ori.ClaimChatProvider` sets `Chat Provider Type` to `LanguageModels` on install, but only while it is still `None`, so it never overrides another app or an administrator.

`LangModel Chat Provider ori` still owns everything LM-specific: it resolves the active language model — the user's `Bifrost Language Model Code`, else the default model — reads its `Chat Provider` enum value and calls through the `Bifrost LangModel Provider ori` interface. That interface has a **single** method taking a `Bifrost Chat Argument ori` temporary record; the requested operation is a `Bifrost Chat Proc. Type ori` enum value on that record. New operations are added as enum values, so the interface signature never changes and existing providers keep compiling.

### The permission gate

`Chat Gate ori` is now Foundation's empty table whose only purpose is `WritePermission()`; Foundation's `Bifrost Chat Mgt ori.HasChatPermission()` reads it. Only `BIFROST Chat ori` grants write access — deliberately not `BIFROST LLM ori`, so a chat licence is an explicit administrative act. The FactBox hides itself when the gate is closed or the active provider reports not configured.

### Skill injection

The language model's Markdown skill text is prepended to the system prompt of every conversation. `Copilot Default Skill ori` supplies the shipped default.

## Rules for Agents

- **Do not modify `bc-origo-bifrost-core`.** Read it freely; the Foundation coordinator owns it.
- Namespace on line 1; `using Origo.Bifrost;` wherever a Foundation object is referenced.
- Object names are fixed. Renaming one is a breaking change for every tenant that has the app installed.
- New object ids come from 10035335-10035484 (tests 96000-96199), including enum extension value ids and table extension field ids.
- Compile with CodeCop + UICop + AppSourceCop and accept nothing but zero errors and zero warnings.
- Implementation means code **and** tests **and** documentation. Publish and run the tests on both containers before calling anything done.
- Never print, log or store the `BC28IS_USER` / `BC28IS_PASSWORD` values.
